// BASIC Theory 

// AJAX: asynchronous javaScript and XML

// GOAL: HTTP request

// communication between client and server done by HTTP(Hypertext transfer protocol)
// Our client is brower usually 
// and we use mostly javascript to retrieve, create and update data from backend
// and server in Backend can be return in any language django,Node,PHP

// XML is format of data
// AJAX is a set of "web development techinques" using many web technologies on the "client-side" to create asynchronous web applications

// with AJAX, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchornously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behaviour of the exisiting page 

// we don't use data in XML format anymore.
// we use JSON now. 

// we have 3 most common ways to create and send request to the server
// 1.) XMLHttpRequest (old way of doing)
// 2.) fetch API (new way of doing)
// 3.) AXIOS (this is a third party library)

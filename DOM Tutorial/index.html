    <!-- Way-3 -->
    <!-- <script src="./102.js" async></script>     -->
    <!-- above one is the solution of way-2 -->
    <!-- how it works?? -->
    <!-- Work done by browser -> 1. parsing >> 2. stopped at script line read async their after reading async broswer realised that he don't have to stop parsing he should continue parsing with JS loding more concisly we can say async give power to browser to continue Parsing + JS loading together. -->
    <!-- Here If JS file loaded completely so Loading of JS will get stopped as parsing and loading process are going together so parsing of html file also get stopped -->
    <!-- Then after executing of Js file starts -->
    <!-- Limitations :- -->
    <!-- But hey hey hey look here what if laading of Js file get stopped in between and html file didn't parse completely so there will be the chance of error from Js file coz html file only half parsed -->
    <!-- So this method also need some improvement -->
    
    <!-- Way-4 -->
    <!-- To use defer in place of async -->
    <!-- <script src="./DOM_basic.js" defer></script> -->
    <!-- <script src="./DOM_use.js" defer></script> -->
    <script src="./DOM_deep.js" defer></script>
    <!-- here as browser reads defer he started to do same loading of JS and parsing of html together/simultaneously as in async method -->
    <!-- But the thing which is different here is even JS will completely load parsing will not stop. Means if Js load completely in between of parsing so it will not affect parsing as parsing will go for its completion and then after parsing completion browser executes JS file -->
    <!-- So This is the best method -->
    <!-- Let's look how time get saved here -->
    <!-- 1. parsing  -->
    <!-- 2. parsing + loading  -->
    <!-- 2a. parsing (if Loading is already completed) -->
    <!-- 2b. loading (if parsing is already completed)-->
    <!-- 4. executing -->
    <!-- Defer is the best way to link JS file with html file -->


    <!-- Way-1 -->
    <!-- <script src="./102.js"></script> -->
    <!-- Limitation to add it here -->
    <!-- It goes to browser and he parse html file and when he come into this line he get that he have to load a JS file and he load a JS file completely >> here parsing get stopped and will not read further coz after load, browser execute JS file and as in JS file those all html tags are present and as for browser it is unavailable till now so it will throw a error -->

    <!-- What if we use here?? -->
    <!-- Browser did same for html file and JS file till excute JS file ( JS file : Load first then Execute ) and this time it get executed well because browser already parse full html till here -->
    <!-- But Limitation are here as well ->  Lets understand it with work done by browser to load full page -->
    <!-- 1. HTML parse -> time+ -->
    <!-- 2. JS Load -> time+ -->
    <!-- 3. JS execute -> time+ -->
    <!-- So as we can see this method will take time to conduct each operation for web page  -->
    <!-- But the point here is that I can improve this time and it can be possible if browser two process together -->
